# bobail_mobile

Bobail is a game I discovered and later realized is not as popular as one would think. 

If you are unfamiliar with it, it's a two player game. The objective is to move the bobail (middle piece) towards your side of the board. 

To do that, you can move the bobail like a chess king, 
and then one of your pieces like a queen with the exception that one must always move the pieces as far as one can.

So players have to use their pieces cleverly to move or force the bobail towards their side. 

## Getting Started

This project currently has 3 parts. 
- The bobail engine itself. Anyone can build another interface for it and use it (my first version was in terminal, feel free to try that) 
- A flutter wrapper. I'm learning flutter and I don't consider myself good at that nor UX/UI. But this version should do enough.
- An AI for the game built using the engine I built and known algorithms.
